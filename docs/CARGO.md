# Cargo Configuration Notes

Unless you are using a distro that has the latest cargo on its native package manager repo, it's best that you follow the [official installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) guide from rust-lang.org to install cargo. Otherwise, you may run into some dependencies issues when you update with app.
